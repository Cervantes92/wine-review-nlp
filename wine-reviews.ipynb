      " 'This is a pretty eastern U.S. Merlot, with its subtle, nuanced flavors of red berry, plum and currant and its approachable, soft tannins. Virginia is showing its talent for growing reds and this is a good example of what can be done with good vineyard management and winemaking.'\n",
      " 'This spicy, fruity blend sources from seven different vineyards, and includes 5% portions of Cabernet Franc and Syrah. The acids bring up hints of pink grapefruit and orange, while the cherry and plum fruit flavors hold the center. The wine seems to thin out a bit through the finish.'\n",

      " 'Pure and fruity, this medium-bodied wine is supersmooth in texture, quietly flavorful and well balanced. The light acidity and mild tannins are well integrated and support delicious black-cherry and blueberry flavors perfectly.'\n",
      " 'This firmly built Merlot shows almost Cabernet-like reserve in its tobacco, cherry and cassis shadings that finish woody, warm and firm. At the moment, the copious oak sits atop the fruit, suggesting at least another 2‚Äì3 of cellaring prior to full enjoyment.'\n",
      " 'Fruit and barrel aromas intermingle, with notes of vanilla, coconut, wood spice, clove and red berries. The red fruit flavors are fresh and focused, with lightly grainy tannins providing the frame.'\n",
      " 'From a small parcel in the Lamothe-Vincent vineyard, this rich, structured wine shows a strong relationship with terroir and minerality. It has power and intensity, while still preserving enough freshness. Drink from 2016.'\n",
      " 'Extremely ripe fruit flavors fuel this full-bodied, no-holds barred wine. The aromas are like blackberry jam and raspberry syrup, and the flavors are almost that extreme, but the wine is technically dry. A very viscous texture wraps it up.']\n"

Thus, a term that appears numerous times in a handful of sentences will be given a higher score than a term that appears in almost all of the sentences. This works best for us because there will be numerous useless terms that likely appear in all sentences (wine, taste, smell) and useful terms that will appear in only a few sentences (such as specific smells and tastes).\n",

    "\n",
    "To get a better idea of the linguistics used in our wine reviews, we will use unsupervised clustering techniques to group similar reviews. We can use this information to determine if there are dramatic differences in review styles and which authors tend to write what styles. We may even pull out certain attributes associated with these styles.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several clustering techniques we could use, but the process by which we begin the process of modeling essentially begin the same; our linguistic observations (paragraphs, pages et al) are turned into vectors. One method of doing so is called the 'term-document matrix' (tdf). In tdf, stopwords such as 'the', 'is', 'and' et. al. are ignored, all other words are reduced to their lemmas (tasting => taste), and the presence-absense of each word (or the frequency therein) is encoded in a matrix in which each row represents a document, and each column represents a term.\n",
    "\n",
    "As it goes, words that appear often (such as the word 'wine' in our wine reviews) are much less impactful than less common words. We therefore need to penalize words that occur too often by calculating the inverse document frequency."
