      " 'This is a pretty eastern U.S. Merlot, with its subtle, nuanced flavors of red berry, plum and currant and its approachable, soft tannins. Virginia is showing its talent for growing reds and this is a good example of what can be done with good vineyard management and winemaking.'\n",
      " 'This spicy, fruity blend sources from seven different vineyards, and includes 5% portions of Cabernet Franc and Syrah. The acids bring up hints of pink grapefruit and orange, while the cherry and plum fruit flavors hold the center. The wine seems to thin out a bit through the finish.'\n",

    "\n",
    "We will use __Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency__ (TFIDF) to extract the features for our corpus. This will give us some insights into some of the common threads available in our reviews we can use to better understand what properties of wine the critics observe.\n",
    "\n",
    "TF-IDF works by subtracting the inverse of how often a term appears in a document from the whole-corpus term frequency (all of these measurements being normalized). Thus, a term that appears numerous times in a handful of sentences will be given a higher score than a term that appears in almost all of the sentences. This works best for us because there will be numerous useless terms that likely appear in all sentences (wine, taste, smell) and useful terms that will appear in only a few sentences (such as specific smells and tastes).\n",

    "\n",
    "To get a better idea of the linguistics used in our wine reviews, we will use unsupervised clustering techniques to group similar reviews. We can use this information to determine if there are dramatic differences in review styles and which authors tend to write what styles. We may even pull out certain attributes associated with these styles.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several clustering techniques we could use, but the process by which we begin the process of modeling essentially begin the same; our linguistic observations (paragraphs, pages et al) are turned into vectors. One method of doing so is called the 'term-document matrix' (tdf). In tdf, stopwords such as 'the', 'is', 'and' et. al. are ignored, all other words are reduced to their lemmas (tasting => taste), and the presence-absense of each word (or the frequency therein) is encoded in a matrix in which each row represents a document, and each column represents a term.\n",
    "\n",
    "As it goes, words that appear often (such as the word 'wine' in our wine reviews) are much less impactful than less common words. We therefore need to penalize words that occur too often by calculating the inverse document frequency."
